## Pricing

My standard rates are \$30.00 (USD)/hour for consulting and \$25.00 for tutoring; however, please feel free to ask me to quote a fixed price for your project.

To provide an accurate quote and turnaround time, please send your objectives, problems, and current draft (if applicable) with an established deadline for your project to robertschnitman@gmail.com. I also am open to arranging a call or in-person meeting with you.

All prices are negotiable.

## Disclaimers

1. My normal working days are Monday through Friday--I am open to discussing weekend availability. 

2. For individuals or organizations concerned about security issues with respect to sending and receiving files, encrypted email systems are recommended. Alternatively, cloud services are acceptable if they use advanced security methods (Dropbox is adequate, but The Box Sync and MEGA Sync are preferable). 

3. To promote and ensure academic honesty, I do not complete work for students. This policy extends to problem sets, papers, exams, and other related assessment materials. Instead, I provide tutoring services: proofreading, critiquing papers, advice on troubleshooting statistical code, and reviewing non-exam assignments. This disclaimer extends to third parties acting on behalf of a student (i.e. parties whose clientele are students). 

4. Depending on the nature of the project, I will kindly ask for co-authorship or acknowledgement for any materials that will be published publicly (e.g. white papers, academic articles, etc). In other words, I do not "ghost write" for individuals nor organizations. 

5. Pricing, estimated duration, and expected responsibilities of the project are all negotiable.
