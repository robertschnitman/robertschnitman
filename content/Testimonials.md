* "Excellent work, I can wholeheartedly recommend Robert very fast and high quality work and service." - Great Britain

* "I would highly recommend Robert. He helped me run statistical analysis on a data set and provided a clear recommendation of who my target customer is for my small business. He made a report on my data that was easy to read and displayed nice graphs and stated his key findings. He was very responsive and exceeded my expectations. I will definitely use him again in the future! Thanks again, Robert!!! " - Canada

* "As I was curled up in the fetal position crying my eyes out determined that I would never learn R, I happened to Google tutors in my area. I found Robert. He came to my house the same day! Robert has a natural skill as a teacher. He's able to perfectly balance allowing me to make mistakes and try to talk myself through things, while intervening and helping if I'm too far off track. His knowledge and skill set are tremendously helpful. He was able to answer all of my dumb coding questions and clearly explain what everything means. Looking forward to many more R sessions in the future!"  - United States

* "If you are looking for an experienced R-Studio tutor, Robert is the man! He’s friendly, patient, and so knowledgeable in the field and explains the process of what he is doing. He asks questions along the way to get a feel of what you know and to check for understanding. I feel like I had many “stupid questions” and was rather embarrassed to ask my professors for help, but when working with Robert, I felt open to ask for clarification and assistance. If you need help in R Studio and don’t know what to do or where to begin, Robert can provide the guidance you need to succeed in your class and learning." - United States

* "This is my second tutoring session with Robert and I can tell you that Robert is extremely knowledgeable with R. He is probably the most knowledgeable person in the subject that I have came across. He can break down and help you maneuver the coding with ease. I understand the program much more when he teaches me code in an hour of tutoring than the hours upon hours that I spend in class with my professor! Along with that, he explains the econometrics homework that we have been working on in a better fashion as well and makes the analysis easier to understand. I'll definitely continue to reach out to Robert whenever I have questions about R coding or econometrics. If you need help with econometrics or R coding, this is your guy!" - United States

* "Mr. S. was very patient, knowledgeable, and displaying a thorough interest with helping in the R studio software. He helped with how to understand and write syntaxes, interpret graphs, Durbin Watson Test, went over the definitions of Independence of Observations, and Homogeneity of Variance. Showed interest and care in helping with understanding my homework." - United States

* "Robert has helped me with Rstudio and Applied Regressions. I feel comfortable asking silly or obvious questions. He creates a healthy learning environment and allows me to grow one step at a time! :)" - United States

* "Robert is brilliant and incredible! I highly recommend him! Thank you so much, Robert!!" - United States

* "Robert helped us wrote a piece of R code for data cleaning. He has a very good sense of detail and remind us of details that we didn't pay attention to. It was great working with Robert. Definitely recommended." - United States

* "Robert helped me out for 3+ hours on my econometrics project. He was very keen and read the files that I sent beforehand so we could get to work right away. I would definitely recommend him and ask again for a lesson if I ever need help. This was my first time using this site [WyzAnt] and I’m pleased with the lesson I got!" - United States. Brackets added by me for clarification.

* "Robert responded to a last minute request I made for help on fixing my machine learning code errors in R for one of my graduate school course projects, which was due within hours! He was able to quickly diagnose the issues and fix all my errors, using at times, alternative approaches in order to run my models. He listened carefully to what I was trying to achieve, even when my explanations were terrible. If it wasn't for Robert, I would have not been able submit my project on time because of the difficulties I was encountering. Lastly, he proposed certain things to enhance my code. I hope to continue working with him on outside-academia work related projects in the coming weeks ahead. I absolutely recommend Robert!" - United States
