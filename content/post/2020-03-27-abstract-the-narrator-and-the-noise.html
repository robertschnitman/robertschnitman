<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>The focus of this study is to determine the existence and extent of statistical bias towards any of the Doki Doki Literature Club characters with respect to the points distribution of the Poem Minigame. The results of this study show that the bias is towards Sayori (2.180 +/- 0.819 vs. overall mean of 1.962 +/- 0.839), who is the first character in the game to experience a traumatic outcome, suggesting that the statistical component of the Poem Minigame–whether intentional or not–attempts to gear the player towards her to accentuate further the emotional impact of her death in Act 1.</p>
