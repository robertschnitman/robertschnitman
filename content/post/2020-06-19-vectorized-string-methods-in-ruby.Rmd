# 1. Introduction

I have been dabbling with the Ruby programming language for work purposes lately. Overall, I enjoy its concise, fun syntax and string methods such as `.chomp` to remove new-line characters--and I especially like the compactness of `map`. However, I believe that I have been too accustomed to R's default property of functions being vectorized, as I initially had some trouble with handling arrays and employing string methods. Although I could apply `map` every time I wanted to perform string operations on an array, I eventually came up with a solution: develop vectorized string methods.

In this post, I will present some string methods that I've written that you may find useful. Give them a try!

# 2. `gsubm`

The method `gsubm` is intended to behave the same as `gsub()` from R: it searches an array based on a pattern and then replaces it with a specified string value.

Here is how `gsubm` is defined and how it's applied in Ruby.

```{ruby}
# Defining gsubm()
class Array
  def gsubm(pattern, replace)

	  self.map {|x| x.gsub(pattern, replace)}
	  
  end
  
end

# Example
## Note that regular expressions are encased in forward slashes. 
gems = ["Ruby", "Crystal", "Emerald"]

p gems.gsubm(/r/, "Z") 
```

# 3. `detect/detectm`

Similar to R's `grepl()`, `detect` outputs a Boolean value based on a given regular expression pattern, while `detectm` performs `detect` over an array.

```{ruby}
# detect
class String

	def detect(pattern)
	
		pattern.match?(self)
		
	end
end

# detectm
class Array

  def detectm(pattern)
	
		self.map {|x| x.detect(pattern)}
		
	end
	
end

# Example
gems = ["Ruby", "Crystal", "Emerald"]

p gems.detectm(/^R/)
	
```

# 4. `extract`

Similar to `grep(..., value = TRUE)` from R, `extract` will return a value that matches a given regular expression pattern--if a pattern is not found, a `nil` value (i.e., a missing value, equivalent to R's `NA`) is produced.

```{ruby}
class Array

  def extract(pattern)
	
		self.map{|x| x[pattern]}
	
	end
	
end

gems = ["Ruby", "Crystal", "Emerald"]

p gems.extract(/^R.*/)
```


# 5. Conclusion

I hope you found these methods to be useful and will apply them into your own work! The `gsubm` method would be particularly beneficial for substituting strings based on a regular expression pattern. R enthusiasts may enjoy `detect/detectm` for its similarity to `grepl()`. Finally, R programmers may also like `extract` to be able to replicate `grep()` to an extent. Overall, these methods would help in managing arrays of strings by being vectorized versions of eisting ruby methods.
