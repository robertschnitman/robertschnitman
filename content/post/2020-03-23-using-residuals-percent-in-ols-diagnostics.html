<p>Many students (myself included) were taught to analyze the <em>raw</em> residuals when diagnosing regression models, but not in terms of <em>percent</em>. The benefit of the latter is that we can assess the relative magnitude of error from our regression model.</p>
<p>To display the residuals as a percent (henceforth <em>Residuals, %</em>), let’s first load some necessary libraries.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>libs &lt;- c(&#39;tidyverse&#39;, &#39;magrittr&#39;, &#39;ggthemes&#39;, &#39;gridExtra&#39;)

# For each library, check if they are installed.
## If not, install and load them.
for (i in libs) {
  
  if (!require(i, character.only = TRUE)) {
    
    install.packages(i)
    library(i, character.only = TRUE)
    
  }
  
}</code></pre>
<p>Second, let’s estimate a model and generate the fitted values and residuals. We’ll use the <code>mtcars</code> dataset pre-loaded into R for this example.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Estimate model.
## mtcars is pre-loaded into R.
mymodel &lt;- lm(mpg ~ wt + hp + gear + am, mtcars)

# Generate fitted and residual values.
fr &lt;- data.frame(fit = predict(mymodel),
                 res = resid(mymodel))

# Residuals as proportions.
fr$res_pct &lt;- with(fr, res/(fit + res))</code></pre>
<p>Third, let’s generate a scatter plot between the residuals percents and the fitted values, as well as a histogram of the former.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Set up 1x2 plot.
par(mfrow = c(1, 2))

# Scatter plot
with(fr, plot(res_pct ~ fit,
              ylab = &#39;Residuals, %&#39;,
              xlab = &#39;Fitted Values&#39;,
              col  = &#39;cyan4&#39;,
              main = &#39;Residuals, % vs. Fitted Values&#39;))
abline(h = 0, lty = 2)

# Histogram
hist(fr$res_pct, 
     col  = &#39;salmon&#39;,
     main = &#39;Distribution of Residuals %&#39;,
     xlab = &#39;Residuals, %&#39;)</code></pre>

<p>We can replicate these graphs with <code>ggplot2</code> graphics.</p>
<pre class="r"><code># Scatter plot
g1 &lt;- ggplot(fr) + 
  aes(y = res_pct, x = fit) + 
  geom_point(col = &#39;cyan4&#39;) + 
  geom_hline(yintercept = 0, linetype = 2) + 
  labs(y = &#39;Residuals, %&#39;,
       x = &#39;Fitted Values&#39;,
       title = &#39;Residuals, % vs. Fitted Values&#39;) + 
  theme_calc() # From ggthemes.

# Histogram
g2 &lt;- ggplot(fr) + 
  aes(x = res_pct) + 
  geom_histogram(col = &#39;black&#39;, 
                 fill = &#39;salmon&#39;,
                 bins = NROW(fr)/2) + 
  labs(x = &#39;Residuals, %&#39;,
       title = &#39;Distribution of Residuals %&#39;) + 
  theme_calc() # From ggthemes.

# Arrange the ggplots in a grid
grid.arrange(g1, g2, ncol = 2, nrow = 1) # From gridExtra.</code></pre>

<p>In summary, we have learned how to calculate <em>Residuals, %</em> and graph them with Base R and <code>ggplot2</code>. Try using these techniques the next time you diagnose your models!</p>
