      <description>IntroductionA couple years ago, I started a writing a package on Github that was inspired by the data managment functionalities in other statistical software such as Stata and SPSS. I got distracted by life, especially with work, and I practically stopped developing the package in 2019. This year, however, I finally sat down and finished developing this package, R documentation and all: the end-result was dm.
You can read the documentation on this package as a Gitbook online.</description>

      <description>I have a new book in progress called A Short Introduction to Applied Statistical Programming in R, which can be viewed online as a Gitbook or as a PDF. [EDIT 2020-04-01: I will primarily focus on the Gitbook version, as I am running into some typesetting issues with the PDF at the moment.]
[EDIT 2020-04-02: The Gitbook version is fairly complete and I do not foresee many major updates to it unless they are requested or if I think of anything else significant to add.</description>
