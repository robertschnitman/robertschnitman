      <description>I have a new book in progress called A Short Introduction to Applied Statistical Programming in R, which can be viewed online as a Gitbook or as a PDF. [EDIT 2020-04-01: I will primarily focus on the Gitbook version, as I am running into some typesetting issues with the PDF at the moment.]
[EDIT 2020-04-02: The Gitbook version is fairly complete and I do not foresee many major updates to it unless they are requested or if I think of anything else significant to add.</description>
