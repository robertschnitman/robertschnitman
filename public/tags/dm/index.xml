      <description>IntroductionA couple years ago, I started a writing a package on Github that was inspired by the data managment functionalities in other statistical software such as Stata and SPSS. I got distracted by life, especially with work, and I practically stopped developing the package in 2019. This year, however, I finally sat down and finished developing this package, R documentation and all: the end-result was dm.
You can read the documentation on this package as a Gitbook online.</description>
