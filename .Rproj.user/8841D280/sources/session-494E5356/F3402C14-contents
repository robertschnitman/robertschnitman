While I primarily have been focusing on my current employment and freelance projects, I also have made incremental changes to existing packages/repos on my GitHub. In particular, I have renamed `VBAops` to `XLops`, which serves as the primary repo where I will write and maintain utility functions for Excel and VBA. Similarly, `LBops` contains similar modules for LibreOffice Basic/Calc.

# Modules

`FunText`: Functions for parsing text.

`FunDates`: Functions for parsing dates.

`FunLogic`: Boolean functions for common scenarios.

`FunLookup`: Simplified variations of `*LOOKUP()`/`*MATCH()` functions.
